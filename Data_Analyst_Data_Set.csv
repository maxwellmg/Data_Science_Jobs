Evaluation of Education: The primary requirement of operations research work is competence in the rigorous methods of scientific inquiry and analysis rather than in the subject matter of the problem.

Evaluation of Education:

The primary requirement of operations research work is competence in the rigorous methods of scientific inquiry and analysis rather than in the subject matter of the problem.

The following are illustrative of acceptable courses: optimization; mathematical modeling; queueing theory; engineering; physics (except descriptive or survey courses); econometrics; psychometrics; biometrics; experimental psychology; physical chemistry; industrial process analysis; managerial economics; computer science; measurement for management; mathematical models in social phenomena; and courses that involved application of operations research techniques and methodologies to problems of management, marketing, systems design, and other specialized fields; or other comparable quantitative analysis courses for which college-level mathematics or statistics is a prerequisite. Courses in theory of probability and statistics are highly desirable but are not specified as minimum educational requirements because to do so would possibly exclude some applicants who would otherwise be well qualified.

In addition to meeting the basic education requirement above, applicants must also meet the below specialized experience:

Specialized Experience:One year of specialized experience which includes analyzing innovative war games for the organization while offering analytical expertise to tackle complex operational and logistical challenges; conducting comprehensive war game analyses to guide senior leaders on strategic options, evaluating new force structures, technologies, doctrines, and logistics initiatives; assessing war gaming methodologies to ensure alignment with National Security and Military Strategy goals for informed leadership decisions; and conducting in-depth analyses of new programs, policies, and approaches, while advising senior leaders on strategic alternatives to critical issues.This definition of specialized experience is typical work performed at the next lower grade/level position in the federal service (GS-13)."
